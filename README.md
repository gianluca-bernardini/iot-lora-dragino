# iot-lora-dragino
This repo contains sample code to experiment with LoRa and the Watson IoT platform.
The device being used for the LoRa transmission part is based on dragino (http://www.dragino.com/) and the sketches here are a modified version of the sample code that comes with the dragino toolkit.
The server part of the example is specifically modified to interact with the Watson IoT platform, assuming you have registered your dragino gw as a gatway into the Watson IoT platform
See the following documentation about how to register a Gateway to Watson IoT:
